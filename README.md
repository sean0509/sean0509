# 👋 Hi, I'm Sean!

🎓 I'm a BSc IT graduate (with just 1 KT left to clear 😅), and I'm currently learning Java to become a backend developer.

🚀 I recently built my first project: an ATM Console App in Java (hosted on GitHub!).

💻 I'm passionate about tech, clean UI, and building things from scratch.

📚 Currently learning:
- Java (Core + OOP)
- Git & GitHub
- SQL basics

🛠️ Tools & IDEs:
- Eclipse
- GitHub Desktop
- Git Bash
- VS Code

📈 Next goal: Land a job as a backend developer by the end of the year!
